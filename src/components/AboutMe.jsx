<h1>About me ....</h1>
<p>
I am a dynamic and autonomous person who enjoys interacting with clients and colleagues. 
I had the opportunity, two years ago, to work on the small problems of the website, where I was working, at Les Affutés, Montréal. When i was there and really like it. I just finished my web development Bootcamp at COncordia University and am eager to know more and to take real life challenge on the technological market !
